# cgel

This repo includes code for converting Universal Dependencies-formalism trees into the syntactic formalism from the *Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* (*CGEL*). CGEL gold data in the repo is annotated by Brett Reynolds (@brettrey3 on Twitter, who also runs @DailySyntaxTree).

![Status](https://github.com/nert-nlp/cgel/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)

## Datasets
We have two portions of our resulting dataset: a small set of sentences with both gold CGEL and UD trees, and a larger set of trees from EWT with complete CGEL silver parses.

**The gold data resides in 4 files:**

- `datasets/{twitter.cgel, twitter_ud.conllu}`: CGEL gold trees from Twitter with corresponding UD trees (silver from Stanza then manually corrected by Nathan Schneider)
- `datasets/{ewt.cgel, ewt_ud.conllu}`: UD gold trees from EWT train set, with corresponding CGEL trees (manually annotated by Brett Reynolds)

Both portions were revised with the aid of consistency-checking scripts.

Other subdirectories contain older/silver versions of the trees.

To load the CGEL trees for scripting, use the `cgel.py` library.

## Structure
- `cgel.py`: library that implements classes for CGEL trees and the nodes within them, incl. helpful functions for printing and processing trees in PENMAN notation
- `clausetype.py`: enriches UD trees with CGEL clause type features
- `constituent.py`:
- `graph.py`: generates figures for papers
- `parse_forest.py`: parses original trees made by Brett Reynolds in LaTeX using the `forest` package into machine-readable formats
- `parse.py`: ditto but for older trees using the `parsetree` package
- `ud2cgel.py`: converts UD trees (from English EWT treebank) to CGEL format using rule-based system
- `validate_trees.py`: script to check the well-formedness of trees

**Folders**
- `analysis/`: scripts for analysing the datasets
- `convertor/`: includes conversion rules in DepEdit script + outputs from conversion, with a simple Flask web interface for local testing in the browser (English text > automatic UD w/ Stanza > CGEL)
- `datasets/`: all the final output datasets, incl. gold UD for the gold CGEL data (more detailed description TBD)
- `figures/`: figures generated by `graph.py`
- `scripts/`: one-off scripts that were used to clean/restructure data
- `trees/`: input trees in LaTeX that were converted into CGEL PENMAN trees
