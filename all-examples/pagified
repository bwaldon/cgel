@178| `Epistemic' is derived from the Greek for knowledge: this kind of modality involves qualifications concerning the speaker's knowledge. The unmodalised He has been delayed presents the truth of the proposition as something I know, whereas [8ia] presents it as something I arrive at by inference and in [ib] I merely put it forward as a possibility. `Deontic' is derived from the Greek for binding, so that here it is a matter of imposing obligation or prohibition, granting permission, and the like. In [iia], for example, I am telling you to pull your socks up and in [iib] I give you permission to stay. The person, authority, convention or whatever from whom the obligation, etc. is understood to emanate we refer to as the deontic source.
